# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Overview
This repository contains an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project completed as part of the **CS675 course**. The project focuses on understanding data through cleaning, transformation, and visualization, providing valuable insights to aid in decision-making.  

Key objectives include handling missing data, detecting outliers, and converting data to numeric formats for analysis readiness. This repository is a step-by-step guide for aspiring data analysts or anyone interested in EDA best practices.

---

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Address missing values (nulls, NaNs), remove inconsistencies, and standardize data.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identify and transform outliers to improve data integrity.
- **EDA Tools**: Use Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for hands-on data analysis.
- **Automated Profiling**: Incorporates `ydata-profiling` and `sweetviz` to generate detailed reports.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries**: 
  - Data Manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **EDA Tools**: `ydata-profiling`, `sweetviz`

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-2-eda.git
   cd project-2-eda
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   > The `requirements.txt` includes all necessary packages such as `ydata-profiling` and `sweetviz`.

---

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Project-2.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to:
   - Explore the dataset structure.
   - Detect and address missing values and outliers.
   - Generate automated EDA reports.
   - Visualize data trends and distributions.
